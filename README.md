# PROJECT:- PUSH BUTTON COUNTER

# AIM OF PROJECT:-

DESIGN A SIMPLE EMBEDDED SYSTEM USING A MICROCONTROLLER TO COUNT AND DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF TIMES A PUSH BUTTON IS PRESSED. THIS INVOLVES DEBOUNCING THE BUTTON TO ENSURE ACCURATE COUNTING AND DISPLAYING THE COUNT ON A SERIAL MONITOR.

# Components used:
1) Microcontroller: Arduino UNO
2) Push button with pull-down resistor
3) Debouncing (software-based)
4) Power supply (5V)

# Connections:
1) Push button:
- One end to digital pin 2
- Other end to GND
- Use a 10kÎ© pull-up or internal pull-up enabled in code

# Working
- The microcontroller checks the state of the button.
- Debouncing ensures the button press is valid (not noise).
- On a valid press, the count is incremented.
- The count is displayed either on the serial monitor .

# SOFTWARES USED IN THIS PROJECT:-

1) ARDUINO IDE
2) TINKER CAD
3) PROTEUS

# Use Cases of Push Button Counter with Microcontroller
1) Digital Tally Counter
2) User Input Interface in Embedded Devices
3) Debouncing Demonstration for Education
4) Interface for Event Triggers
